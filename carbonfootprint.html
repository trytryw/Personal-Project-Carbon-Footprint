Carbon emissions are carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases are gases that keep the energy from the sun within the earth’s atmosphere, greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane. Greenhouse gases are called greenhouse gases because it creates an effect that is similar to how greenhouses keep heat as if the earth’s atmosphere has more greenhouse gases then the earth would have a higher temperature due to more energy from the sun heating up the earth.

                        <p class="card-text"><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since a carbon footprint causes carbon emissions and these carbon dioxide emissions cause the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere, the effects of the greenhouse effect are also effects of carbon emissions. The most significant effect of the greenhouse effect would be how it causes climate change, climate change is caused by the amount of carbon emissions increasing thus causing the greenhouse effect which in turn heats up the earth, heating up the earth which results in climate change. Climate change has many impacts on our society, for example, it causes sea levels to rise which will if climate change goes unstopped cause many coastal cities and even countries with low elevation to be completely underwater. Climate change also causes more extreme weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes which can cause vast amounts of destruction. Another impact of carbon emissions is that carbon emissions cause air pollution which can cause respiratory diseases. Carbon emissions have many negative impacts so it is important to keep track of our individual carbon footprint so we can reduce our carbon emissions and reduce the rate of climate change. </span><br><br></p>

                        <p class="card-text"><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The easiest way to reduce your carbon footprint is to see what your carbon footprint is being caused by, this can be done using a carbon footprint calculator such as the one on this website. With a carbon footprint calculator, you can see what areas your carbon footprint is most affected by and try to cut back on it, for example, you might see that you fly hundreds of times a year and this causes your carbon emissions to be extremely high so, therefore, you would try to take alternatives to flights such as taking the train instead. Another way to reduce your carbon footprint would be to offset your carbon emissions by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for example by planting trees if everyone reduces their carbon footprint we stand a chance against climate change but everyone has to do their part, click the button below to start your journey to reduce your carbon footprint.
